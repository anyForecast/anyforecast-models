scikit-learn compatible library for state-of-the-art forecasting with neural
networks.

deepts achieves sklearn compatibility through
[skorch](https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a neural network library
that wraps PyTorch models into sklearn estimators.


Resources
---------

* Documentation (In progress!)
* [Examples](https://github.com/skorch-forecasting-dev/skorch-forecasting/tree/master/examples)


Installation
------------

deepts requires Python 3.10 or higher.

### From source

```
git clone https://github.com/ramonamezquita/deepts.git
python -m pip install .
```

We recommend to use a virtual environment for this (`python -m venv env`).
